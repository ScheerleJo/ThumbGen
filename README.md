# ThumbnailGenerator

Is a Python application to create thumnails currently semi-automatically for the regular streams on sundays.

In the Future it is planned to create Thumbnails in combination with streams on Youtube to automate at least the creation process.
For this I want to use the calendar .ics file provided by [www.kirchenjahr-evangelisch.de](https://www.kirchenjahr-evangelisch.de) and the Youtube Livestreaming API either in Node.js or Python
