# ThumbnailGenerator

Is a Python application to create thumnails currently semi-automatically for the regular streams on sundays.

## Current Status

It currently supports the date and name of the upcoming Sunday using the downloadable .ics file provided by [www.kirchenjahr-evangelisch.de](https://www.kirchenjahr-evangelisch.de)
IMPORTANT!
The .ics file needs to be named `'kirchenjahr-evangelisch.ics'`

## Future Plans

In the Future it is planned to create Thumbnails in combination with streams on Youtube to automate at least the creation process.
For this I want to use the Youtube Livestreaming API either in Node.js or Python

Another Plan is to have the python-script as an executable and still dynamically create png files
